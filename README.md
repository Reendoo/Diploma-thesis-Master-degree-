Diploma thesis (Master degree)

The aim of the master thesis is to create a geographic information system for the collection and monitoring of separated waste in the town of Rajec. Such information system is to use Smart technology Sensoneo (ultrasonic sensors for measuring the filling of collection containers). The final version of the information system is intended for the waste management employee of the city of Rajec and is intended to provide him with information support in decisions on the planning of collection routes for individual types of waste and the deployment of waste collection stands. The information system monitors the filling of collection containers and records it in statistics. Information on filling is collected on the basis of an SMS with the current status from Sensoneo sensors, or from citizens who send an SMS with the current status of the container by scanning the QR code present on the collection container. The information system also enables the registration of performed (collection and service) journeys of waste management vehicles, which can be used by the worker during planning. Individual components of this information system, such as interface for communication with the SMS gateway, optimization algorithms and heuristics are widely used in practice.
